This is a collection of random documentation for both personal and professional projects. I'm a PhD student at the [Harvard Microrobotics Lab](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/), where I work on soft robotic grasping, so a lot of stuff on here is related to that (useful things for myself so I don't have to remember them). If you're interested in my research, I have a website for it at [cbteeple.com](http://www.cbteeple.com/). I'm also a maker, and I work on a lot of personal projects, some of which are on here.

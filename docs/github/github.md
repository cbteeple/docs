I use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control. Unfortunately I only ever remember the absolute basics of Git, leaving me to google everything that's not a standard workflow in the form:
``` shell
git add .
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git push
```

I also use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host all of these "Just The Docs" websites for my projects, including this very site.

## A nicer startup theme that fills some gaps
I made a customized version of a Grub Theme for a few reasons:
- There are very few nice-looking grub themes online.
- Most grub themes do not accomodate high-res screens

Here I present a variation on the [Poly Dark](https://github.com/shvchk/poly-dark) theme with a few tweaks:
- Colorful icons
- Support for high-resolution screens
- Larger icons and text overall (better use of screen real estate)

## Download the theme

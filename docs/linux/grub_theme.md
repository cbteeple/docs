## A nicer startup theme that fills some gaps
I made a customized version of a Grub Theme for a few reasons:
- There are very few nice-looking grub themes online.
- Most grub themes do not accommodate high-res screens

Here I present a variation on the [Poly Dark](https://github.com/shvchk/poly-dark) theme with a few tweaks:
- Colorful icons
- Support for high-resolution screens
- Larger icons and text overall (better use of screen real estate)

## Download the theme

[<i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Typical Screens]( {{ "assets/files/poly-dark-clark-normal.tar.gz" | absolute_url }} ){: .btn .btn-primary}

[<i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> High-Res Screens]( {{ "assets/files/poly-dark-clark-hires.tar.gz" | absolute_url }} ){: .btn .btn-primary}

[<i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Stretched Low-Res Screens]( {{ "assets/files/poly-dark-clark-narrow.tar.gz" | absolute_url }} ){: .btn .btn-primary}

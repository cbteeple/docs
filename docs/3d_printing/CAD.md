## Fusion 360 Tweaks

1. Use Solidworks pan/rotate commands
	- Go to "User Name" >> "Preferences"
	- Set **Pan, Zoom, Orbit shortcuts** to "**Solidworks**"
2. Set Z axis as up
	- Go to "User Name" >> "Preferences"
	- Set **Default Modeling Orientation** to "**Z up**"
	- _Note: Literally every 3D printing and CNC system sets Z-axis to be up. I don't know why CAD softwares always default to y-axis up._
